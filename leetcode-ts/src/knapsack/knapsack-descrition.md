# Knapsack Problem Description

The Knapsack Problem involves selecting items from a set to maximize value while staying within a weight constraint. The most common variant is the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, where:

    You have a set of items, each with a weight and a value
    You have a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity
    The goal is to choose items to put in the knapsack that maximize total value while not exceeding the weight limit
    Each item can only be selected once (0 or 1 times)

For example, given:

    Items: {Apple, Orange, Banana, Melon}
    Weights: {2, 3, 1, 4}
    Values: {4, 5, 3, 7}
    Knapsack Capacity: 5

The optimal solution would be to choose Banana and Melon, giving a total value of 10 and a total weight of 5

Prim's algorithm

It falls under a class of algorithms called greedy algorithms that find the local optimum in the hopes of finding a global optimum.

Idiea: 
 - We start from one vertex and keep adding edges with the lowest weight until we reach our goal.
 - The number of edges in the Minimum Spanning Tree is `n - 1` in which `n` is the number of nodes
